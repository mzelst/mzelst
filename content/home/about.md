# Biography

My PhD project concerns the integration of backward- and forward-looking decision making in temporally uncertain environments under the supervision of dr. [Federica Angeli](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/f.angeli.htm), dr. [John Bechara](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/j.p.bechara.htm), and dr. [Daniela Blettner](https://beedie.sfu.ca/profiles/DanielaBlettner). In this project we study how decision makers adapt organizational aspirations and behavior in response to performance expectations. Most of these projects focus on organizational performance feedback and behavioral strategy.

I am also interested in outbreak epidemiology, where I apply insights from behavioral theory to policy decisions in the context of public health and infectious disease outbreaks. I advise the department of Health on data and dashboards and am an active member of the [C19 Red Team NL](https://www.c19redteam.nl). I also host a podcast about corona, data, and policy (in Dutch) called [Signaalwaarde](https://www.signaalwaarde.nl).
