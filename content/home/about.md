# Biography

My PhD project concerns the integration of backward- and forward-looking decision making under the supervision of dr. F. Angeli and dr. J.P. Bechara. In this project we study how decision makers adapt organizational aspirations and behavior in a temporally uncertain environment. Most of these projects focus on organizational performance feedback and strategic management.

I am also interested in meta-research, concerning the improvement of science as a field. I am currently working on a framework for a new system of scientific communication.
