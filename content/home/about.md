# Biography

My PhD project concerns the integration of backward- and forward-looking decision making in temporally uncertain environments under the supervision of dr. [F. Angeli](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/f.angeli.htm) and dr. [J.P. Bechara](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/j.p.bechara.htm). In this project we study how decision makers adapt organizational aspirations and behavior in response to performance expectations. Most of these projects focus on organizational performance feedback and behavioral strategy.

I am also interested in meta-research, concerning the improvement of science as a field. I am currently working on a framework for a new system of research communication and evaluation.
