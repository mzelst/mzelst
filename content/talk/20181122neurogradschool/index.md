abstract = "Marino van Zelst is investigating how (meta-)organizations adapt their goals and strategies in response to performance feedback and expectations. He is interested in how communication and evaluation in the current scientific system can be improved, as scholarly research faces threats to its sustainability on multiple domains (access, evaluation, reproducibility, inclusivity). During this interactive workshop, you will address how the current publication system could be improved based on John Rawl’s ‘Theory of Justice’. How would the ideal research communication and evaluation system look like, if designed by you?"
